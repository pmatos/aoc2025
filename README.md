This repository contains Claude Code Opus 4.5 attempts at solving each day of AoC 2026.

I created CLAUDE.md and README.md to start with and then every day, I start 
Claude Code with --dangerously-skip-permissions and tell it to solve today's AoC.

It has access to the time MCP, Github MCP and Context7 MCP.
