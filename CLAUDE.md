==

This repository contains several folders. 
One per each day of the Advent Of Code (https://adventofcode.com/).

On the website, each Advent of Code day/problem contains a description of the problem and
two questions. To access the second question, you need to solve the first. There will be 12 problems in total released from December 1 to December 12.

The authentication values for AoC are in .env, which are not to be upstreamed. 

Each day contains tests which you need to use for validation. Only once you are
confident your solution solves the problems and passes the tests are you 
allowed to stop. 

Write your solutions in Python with types. 
Use a uv environment.
Run pyright to make sure the types are fine. 

Every dayX folder should contain a main file called problem.py that receives as arguments the day's input and should only print to stdout the output.
